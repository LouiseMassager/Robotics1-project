CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:34 (add_executable):
  Cannot generate a safe runtime search path for target
  mara_contact_publisher because there is a cycle in the constraint graph:

    dir 0 is [/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/gazebo-11/plugins]
    dir 1 is [/opt/ros/foxy/lib]
      dir 2 must precede it due to runtime library [liboctomap.so.1.9]
    dir 2 is [/opt/ros/noetic/lib]
      dir 1 must precede it due to runtime library [libgazebo_ros_utils.so]

  Some of these libraries may not be found correctly.
